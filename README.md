# pi-zgrep

This is Rodrigo's Windows-compatible fork of [carvalab/pi-zgrep](https://github.com/carvalab/pi-zgrep), based on upstream 0.3.0. All upstream search modes, filters, commands, automatic indexing, daemon behavior, environment switches, fixtures, documentation and history are retained. See [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md) for the changes and real-host validation.

Install this fork in Pi:

```text
pi install git:github.com/rodrigojager/pi-zgrep@v0.3.1-rodrigo.1
```

The original upstream documentation follows. Its `npm:pi-zgrep` commands install the upstream package, not this fork. This fork is distributed through GitHub, with npm publication disabled.

Semantic code search for the [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) coding agent. One tool, four routes (hybrid, BM25, vector, ripgrep), auto-indexed.

## What your agent gets

- It finds code by meaning. "Where do we parse the upstream output format?" works before anyone knows the symbol names, which is exactly an agent's situation in an unfamiliar repo.
- No setup and no daemon babysitting. The search engine installs as a dependency, the index builds in the background at session start, and a daemon keeps it fresh.
- Exact matching keeps an escape route: `mode=rg` passes the query to managed ripgrep and skips the index.

This is what that looks like on this repository. The agent makes one tool call:

```
zg({ query: "where does the extension parse zg output into results", mode: "hybrid" })
```

and gets ranked `file:line` hits back (real output):

```
doc/specs/2026-09-02-pi-zg-extension.md:55-68    heading: Components
doc/specs/2026-09-02-pi-zg-extension.md:69-76    heading: Data flow
doc/plans/2026-09-02-pi-zg-extension.md:353-426  heading: Task 5: Output parser (src/parse.ts)
```

Nothing in that query is a literal identifier in the codebase. Ripgrep scores zero on questions like this one; see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks) for where the numbers live.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-zgrep
```

Try it without installing first:

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-zgrep
```

The engine, [zvec-grep](https://github.com/zvec-ai/zvec-grep) (Apache-2.0, npm `@zvec/zvec-grep`), ships as a regular npm dependency, so one install brings both. No lifecycle scripts run: npm 12 blocks dependency postinstalls by default, and upstream ships prebuilt native bindings as optional dependencies instead. At runtime the extension resolves the binary in order: `PI_ZG_BIN` (explicit override), the packaged dependency, `zg` on PATH, then a global install on first use (`npm install -g @zvec/zvec-grep`, `bun add -g` fallback, one `--ignore-scripts` retry). pi-zgrep itself is an integrator: the search logic lives upstream, and this package translates a pi tool call into `zg` argv and parses the output.

## The `zg` tool

Local-first semantic + BM25 + hybrid + ripgrep search over the current workspace.

| Parameter  | Type                                  | Default    | Notes                                                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `query`    | string                                | (required) | Natural language, symbol, or regex (for `mode=rg`).                      |
| `mode`     | `hybrid` \| `fts` \| `vector` \| `rg` | `hybrid`   | Search route. `rg` skips the index entirely.                             |
| `limit`    | number (1-50)                         | `10`       | Max results to return.                                                   |
| `glob`     | string                                |            | File filter, e.g. `*.ts`.                                                |
| `type`     | string                                |            | File-type filter.                                                        |
| `refresh`  | `auto` \| `wait`                      | `auto`     | `wait` forces `--refresh wait` after editing a file in the same session. |
| `preview`  | `short` \| `none`                     | `short`    | Include a one-line code preview per result.                              |

Results come back as ranked `file:line` lines. The tool result `details` carry the parsed JSON, kept for future TUI rendering.

## Commands

- `/zg-index [args...]` passes arguments through to `zg index` (for example `--rebuild`). Progress streams in the status line, and the handler notifies you when the build starts and finishes.
- `/zg-status` shows the resolved binary and version, index readiness and freshness, and the daemon pointer. Run it when something looks off; the output tells you whether the index is missing, possibly stale, or fresh.

## How it behaves

### The index is ready before the first question

When a session starts, the extension checks for the binary and, in the background, makes sure the index exists: a missing or stale index builds before you ask anything, with progress on the status line. On a warm repo this costs two cheap spawns (a version probe and a readiness check), and the daemon from your previous session is still running, so nothing new starts. Esc cannot abort a session-start build because it runs in the background; `/zg-index` is the manual control. On bare dev checkouts (`pi -e .` without `npm install`) the binary is not there yet, so startup does nothing and the first tool use installs it.

### The first query builds the index if it has to

A `zg` call that needs the index and does not have one runs `zg index` for you. Build progress streams in the tool output, and Esc aborts the build (the child receives SIGKILL). Partial builds resume incrementally on the next attempt. A failed build surfaces a memoized error on later calls in the same session; start a new session or run `/zg-index`, which bypasses the memo. `mode=rg` queries skip the index entirely.

### A daemon keeps the index fresh

After the first successful build, the extension asks zg to start its background daemon (`zg server on`, loopback-only, detached). The daemon watches the workspace, reconciles the index hourly, and reuses the embedding model across runs. Set `PI_ZG_SERVER` to any non-empty value to opt out and manage the daemon yourself.

### The agent is nudged toward the right route

On every agent turn, the extension appends a short system-prompt note telling the model to prefer `zg` over `grep`/`find`, with mode guidance: `hybrid` for intent, `fts` for symbols, `vector` for paraphrases, `rg` for exact matches. It also says when to fall back: zero results, a tool error, or a `possibly_stale` flag on content the agent just edited. Set `PI_ZG_GUIDANCE` to any non-empty value to disable the nudge.

## Configuration

All env vars are read from the pi process environment (set them before launching pi). The "any non-empty value" convention means setting `PI_ZG_AUTO_INSTALL=1` is the same as `PI_ZG_AUTO_INSTALL=please-stop`.

| Variable              | Effect when set to any non-empty value                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PI_ZG_BIN`           | Path to the `zg` binary. Skips packaged-dependency and PATH lookup. If set but the binary is not executable there, the extension errors out (no fallback). |
| `PI_ZG_AUTO_INSTALL`  | Never auto-install. Error surfaces the exact manual command.                                |
| `PI_ZG_GUIDANCE`      | Do not append the system-prompt nudge.                                                      |
| `PI_ZG_SERVER`        | Do not start the zg daemon after the first build.                                           |

## Troubleshooting

**Install fails.** Run the manual command the extension surfaces:

```bash
npm install -g @zvec/zvec-grep
```

On hosts without node-gyp the first attempt can fail on sharp's optional postinstall. The extension retries once with `--ignore-scripts`; sharp ships a prebuilt binary so the retry works. If both attempts fail, the manual command above still works.

**Offline first index.** The first `zg index` run downloads a local embedding model. If the download fails, the error surfaces verbatim in the tool output. Reconnect, or pre-stage the model cache, and retry.

**`mode=rg` works without an index.** Use it when the index is broken or you want to skip the build step entirely.

**Parse miss.** If upstream changes its output shape, the tool falls back to raw text passthrough prefixed with a hint to run `/zg-status` and file an issue at [carvalab/pi-zgrep](https://github.com/carvalab/pi-zgrep/issues). The fixtures under `test/fixtures/` are the compat tripwire for the parser.

**Windows:** this fork supports packaged JavaScript entries, PATH executables and npm `.cmd` shims. Background processes are hidden, quoted index paths and option values are preserved, and results retain paths with spaces and drive letters. See [WINDOWS.md](WINDOWS.md).

## Benchmarks

The retrieval and answer-quality numbers that matter come from upstream's own benchmark suite, which is bigger and better instrumented than anything we would run here: agent-based A/B runs (zg on and off) with judge scoring on [SWE-QA-Bench](https://github.com/zvec-ai/zvec-grep/blob/main/benchmarks/swe-qa-bench/README.md) (code, Claude Opus 5) and [BrowseComp-Plus](https://github.com/zvec-ai/zvec-grep/blob/main/benchmarks/browse-comp-plus/README.md) (general text, Codex gpt-5.6-sol), plus real-repo case studies on Pylint, Matplotlib, and Django. Method, environments, and results: [upstream benchmark docs](https://github.com/zvec-ai/zvec-grep/blob/main/benchmarks/README.md).

As a local reference we also keep a small latency and hit-rate comparison of zg against ripgrep and GNU grep on this repo's own code. The method and the numbers live in [doc/benchmark.md](doc/benchmark.md); rerun it yourself with `./doc/bench.sh` (130-line script, no dependencies).

## Out of scope in 0.2.0

No override of pi's native `grep`/`find`, no MCP-client mode, no custom TUI rendering, no `@`-mention autocomplete, no bundled skills, no remote embeddings.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carvalab/pi-zgrep.git
cd pi-zgrep
npm install
npm run test            # unit tests (parser, arg builder, ensure chain, guidance)
ZG_TEST_E2E=1 npm run test:e2e   # real zg engine required on PATH
```

Fixtures under `test/fixtures/` are captured from real `zg` 0.2.1 runs and act as the compat tripwire for both the arg builder and the parser. To regenerate a fixture, delete it and re-run the capture commands in `doc/plans/2026-09-02-pi-zg-extension.md` (Task 3), or copy from a fresh `zg` run against `test/fixtures/sample-project/`.

Lint and format are wired through ultracite (oxlint + oxfmt):

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format          # writes changes
npm run format:check    # CI gate
```
