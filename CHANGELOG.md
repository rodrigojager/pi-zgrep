# Changelog

## Unreleased

Rename the shared search skill from `workspace-search` to `pi-zgrep-search` to distinguish it from the retired workspace-search implementation. Keep its instructions and all search behavior unchanged.

## [v0.3.1-rodrigo.1] - 2026-10-03

Windows-compatible fork of the complete upstream 0.3.0 package. Fix process/shim and daemon launching, paths with spaces and drive letters, quoted index arguments and valued flags, query error reporting, current-call cancellation, stderr progress and empty-result parsing. Retain all upstream routes, parameters, commands, lifecycle controls and environment switches.

Add an English workspace-search skill, Pi integration examples, Windows/Linux CI and a real Pi SDK smoke. Validated locally on Windows x64 / Node 26.1.0 / Pi 1.0.0 / engine 0.2.2: lint, formatting, type checks, 62 regression tests, two real-engine E2E tests and 13 Pi SDK checks. See WINDOWS.md for changes and validation boundaries.

All notable changes to pi-zgrep. Release sections are curated before tagging
(user-facing notes, not commit subjects); `git-cliff` with `cliff.toml` drafts
the raw commit list to rewrite from.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

- New `/zg-server` command: start, stop, or inspect the daemon (`on|off|status`) without leaving pi. The daemon still starts on its own, and session warmup now revives it if it died between sessions, so one daemon serves all sessions (upstream enforces a single instance per home). `/zg-status` shows its real state instead of telling you to go run `zg server status` yourself.
- `/zg-index` no longer spawns doomed builds: flags pass straight through to `zg index`, a bare word forwards only when it is an existing workspace path, and anything else gets a usage line pointing at `/zg-status`.
- `/zg-index` and `/zg-server` suggest their arguments in the command palette as you type.
- The zg tool description now leads with "call this tool directly", states the index scope boundary (node_modules, .git, build outputs, and anything outside the workspace are not indexed), gives a concrete example per search mode, and lists all four legit reasons to fall back to grep.
- AGENTS.md documents why the packaged engine outranks any global binary, and the daemon lifecycle.

## [v0.2.2] - 2026-09-03

- npm metadata tune-up for the pi.dev package gallery and npm search: added the author field, broadened keywords (search, grep, hybrid-search, embeddings, rag, coding-agent), and sharpened the description so filters surface the package for the terms people actually type. No code changes.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-09-03

- The `zg` tool description and the session-start guidance now say outright that `zg` is a tool to call directly, not a binary to run from a shell. This fixes agents that ran `which zg`, saw it fail, and quietly fell back to grep instead of using the tool.
- A regression test pins the no-binary wording in the guidance text so a future reword can't drop it.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-09-03

- The zg engine now installs as a regular npm dependency: `pi install npm:pi-zgrep` brings everything with it, no lifecycle scripts involved, safe under npm 12's default script blocking.
- The index builds in the background at session start, so the first search of a session hits a ready index. One build runs per process, and the daemon from a previous session is reused instead of started twice.
- Binary resolution order: `PI_ZG_BIN`, then the packaged engine, then `zg` on PATH, then a global install on first use.
- README rewritten: payoff-first structure with a real output example, and benchmarks that point at upstream's suite (SWE-QA-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus) while ours stays as a local reference.
- Upstream-version safety nets: Dependabot bumps the engine range, and a weekly canary runs unit plus e2e against `@zvec/zvec-grep@latest`, managing a `canary`-labeled tracking issue automatically.
